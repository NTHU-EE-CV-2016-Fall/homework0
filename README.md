## Brief self-introduction
I'm Jia-Wei Wei(魏嘉緯），a junior undergraduate student in NTHUEE. I'm interested in Machine Learning and its application (e.g.,Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing). I currently try to build a voice-controlled robot for sending things indoors.
## Why Computer Vision? 
I have seen lots of different videos about Computer Vision,such as [MIT Interactive Dynamic Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f09VdXex3A),[Google Area Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTZZCtmR3OY). The field is really attractive to me and has great potential. Amazing work from companies like [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com/#/home) and [Umbo CV](https://www.umbocv.com/) also makes me feel excited.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? 
* Have further understanding in Computer Vision.
* Learn the skills needed to have internship in Computer Vision company.
* Try to build an AR/MR application.
* Meet people who are passionate about building useful apps.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
