## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Josuet Leoro and I came from Ecuador to study Robotics here in Taiwan. I studied my master in Mechatronics Engineering at National Taipei University of Techonology (國立台北科技大學). Currently, I am a second year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Chiao Tung University. Robotics is my pasion and I want to learn multiple areas of it. In the future, I want to be a professor back in my country after gaining some experience here in Taiwan.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer vision is one of the areas that I want to learn, so that later I can apply it to robotics. I studied Digital Image Processing while I was studying my master, and I always wanted to extend my knowledge to Computer Visions applications. However, there was not any class offered in English nor in Taipei Tech neither in Chiao Tung. And I was to busy with my research during the master. Therefore, I could not study it by myself. I am happy to be allowed to register to this class and obtain some knowledge of this interesting area. I got the information about this class thanks to the recommendation of Nick Wang, when I took his Robotic Vision class at Chiao Tung. He encoraged me to take this class with professor Sun Min and highly recommended it.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
At the end of this course, I want to be able to understand different Computer Vision algorithms so that I can be able to apply them in future applications. Also, I would like to understand deep learning in specific, since I had often read about its applications. Not only to Computer Vision but also in other areas like control.
