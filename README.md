This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
    hello everyone, my name is bo hao Su, I'm 21 right now, since I studied in Tainan from my junior high, so I always say that I come from Tainan, though I actually live in Kaohsiung. 
    In the college, I major in EE department, and my hobby is listening to the music, jogging or go to the gym, and sometimes I play Leage of Lengend. In the recent days, I tried to study on coding or digital signal processing hard. Hope I could get familiar with it and keep studying it in my future.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
    In the course I have done before, I found that I am pretty interested in processing pictures or videos, after asking some classmates, I hope to learn new technology like computer vision or deep learning in this course. 
    The most important thing is to training myself on the coding and knowledge part.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
    I hope I could learn how deep learning working, some computer vision theorem and even how to process it. I hope I can do something special or fantastic project by using what I have learned in the final.
