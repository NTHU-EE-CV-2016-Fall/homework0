This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Po-Yu Huang 黃柏瑜. I am a first-year graduate school student in VSLab. I have been studying deep learning since last semester, and applying deep learning on vision application is my main research.

Currently, I am digging into the topic that speed up and compress CNN algorithm, trying to apply compact algorithm on embedding system so that we can implement more fascinating application on small device.


## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer vision is an attractive topic. We can imagine a lot of application is related to computer vision. For example, self-driving car, security camera with intelligence and robot. Besides, in my opinion human takes a lot of advantage of  vision clue than other senses. Controlling vision must be the most important step to true A.I. 

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
There are so many vision problems needed to be solved. I want to exploit available tools to find out the solution. If needed, implement it on embedded system and reach real time. Recently, there are some applications using generative model and get astonishing result. It might be my topic. 

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
