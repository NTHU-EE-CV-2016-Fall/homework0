This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am 巫姿瑩, a graduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering in NTHU. I am a member of Vision Science Lab, and my supervisor is Prof. Min Sun. My research interests are in the area of Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Embedded System. Within these fields, my current research project is focus on learning human intention from object and motion interaction with wearable devices. 

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer Vision has become one of the hottest field of study around the world, intending to let machine “see” like human. Based on the knowledge of Image Processing, we can know how to make an image more noiseless or more beautiful. However, in Computer Vision we can know the meaning of an image. Due to the multiple interesting and visionary applications of Computer Vision, I am interested in this area.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I hope to learn the central concept of Computer Vision and some visual processing techniques through the programming projects in this course.
