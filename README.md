This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

### Hey, I'm JhaoCheng Wu from Matsu.

I'm a person who is up for challenges also an energetic developer. After years of pursuing hardware engineering. I found out that I have more interest in software development. Especially in web front-end development and something that can be visualized rather than black background and white text on the terminal. So, here I'm for computer vision.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

There are 2 reasons that I enroll this course. First, I would like to develop something that is visualizable which Computer Vision definitely can do. Second, I'm working on a research project which is **Using ABD & THO signal to detect sleep apnea**. It comes out that I have to handle a large data set. I think some useful concept mentioned in this course like `Machine Learning`, `clustering` and `Deep Learning` will be helpful for my research project.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I think technology is just tools that make people's life better, easier or having more fun, so I want to build somthing can really helpful for some people, or at least, making people happy.
