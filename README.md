This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Jeng Lin Li, a first year graduate student, currently doing the research on human interaction modeling via visual cues in BIIC lab instructed by Chi Chun Lee. I found the experience of DSP and machine learning to be so attractive to me. The amazing achievement of cutting edge techniques also fascinate me. Hopefully, I will dive into this field and make progress.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer vision takes a basic position for computer to understand human's perception. Great efforts have been made on this direction to better human's life. I would like to get involved and try to make a contribution. Besides, the computer vision challenges are interesting since it is close to our real life experience. Visible results are much inspiring and appealing.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
Deep learning techniques provide us effective ways to extract visual features, so I would like to keep delving into the hot topic. On top of that, basic computer vision skills still work in some circumstances. I think it is necessary to learn basic ideas for finding efficient ways to solve problems depending on the applications. Therefore, I expect that I will strengthen my knowledge and apply to more practical cases.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
