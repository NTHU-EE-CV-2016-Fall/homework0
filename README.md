This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
Hi, my name is Dennis Lin 林詩宸. I am now a senior student in NTHU and major in EE. My hobby is watching sports game and talking about sports game. Actually, I am not good at coding so that I'm not familiar with github. However, I am still eager for learning new things. Thus, hope I can learn something and meet new friends here.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
We are live in a generation of technology. Machine learning and deep learning have been the most popular topic so that we need to know and utilize them. After taking DSP course, I am fascinated at processing images. Therefore, I think taking this course is a good idea. 

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
Hope I can learn many things about computer vision and I am interested in Virtual Reality. I want to do a final project about VR.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
