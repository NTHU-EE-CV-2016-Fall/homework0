This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction
I am a CS exchange student at NTHU, coming from Czech Technical University in Prague. Currently undergoing a second half of my undergraduate programme and some of the areas I am interested in include Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.
## Why Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is becoming increasingly useful in today's world of sensors. There is a wide range of use-cases, be it augmented reality, object recognition, model reconstruction or autonomous vehicle navigation. I believe there are still unexplored possibilities where Computer Vision can be applied. Combined with advancements in this field over the last years, Computer Vision appears as an exciting area to me.
## What do I want to achieve in the course?
My goal is to understand the science behind Computer Vision and apply its methods in real-life projects.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
