This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am a postdoc researcher in Dynamic Systems and Control Lab. supervised by Ting-Jen Yeh in PME, NTHU. My research field includes almost everything about control theory and signal processing. Especially, a control theorem that help a system immune from unknown and unobservable bias in measurements from sensors and an anti-slip control for mobile wheeled-inverted pendulum vehicle are the main topics of my dissertation. My recent interest field also includes the motion planning and perception of a robot, which strongly relies on computer vision. Besides academic, I love to play cello. I am a cello player in Hsinchu Municipal Chinese Classical Orchestra.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer Vision helps a robot perceiving the environment and understanding the relative location of itself. Without the technique of Computer Vision, it's almost impossible to make a mechine "intelligent".

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I want to learn the state-of-art technique of Computer Vision for knowing the geometry of the environment as well as identifying objects. This can help building the robot in our next project.

PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
