This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I am a senior student and major in computer science. I have taken many courses about images. 
For example, image processing, computer graphics, OpenGL programing and so on. In this  semester, 
I want to learn more about how computers influence our life if they have the vision same as us.
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Computer vision attracts me so much because of some reasons. First, I took a course, image processing, before,
so I want to learn more skills in high-level application in this semester. 
Second, people have so many behaviors which are influenced by our vision, so I want to know how computers make our life easier if computers see
what we see.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
Learning the basic theorem about computer vision and maybe implementing some basic application of computer vision.
PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
