## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
	Computer Vision is a special topic related to DSP, machine learning, data collecting and analysis. Besides the abstruse mathematical deduction, Computer Vision need plenty of data to let the process available. That's the most different part compare with the courses I took before. As an EE student, I try to attach various fields to build up the fundamental concept and the Computer Vision is the first course in this field. 


## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
	As far as I know, Computer Vision includes almost everything in our daily lives. Any kind of data can be presented in two or three dimension array can be covered by Computer Vision technology. For this reason, I want to choose a people related topic which can interact or help people. I have to work hard to figure out more detail about what I can do and how to do it in the further classes.
