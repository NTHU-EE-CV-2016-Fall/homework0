This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

Robots are more popular in human life. People try to make robots do more things so that our life can be more convenient. In this part, robots need to understand and know what they see, so computer vision is crucial.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

Before I took this cource, I have had some knowledge of deep learning. I tried to use Faster-RCNN/Yolo to detect objects. However, these are just a small part of computer vision. Maybe when I finish this course, I can learn more knowledge in computer vision so that I can do something special in my final project. So excited!
