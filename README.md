## Brief self-introduction
Hi, I am Fu-En.Wang; I am member of VSLAB in National Tsing Hua University.

## Why Computer Vision?
My research is about 3D reconstruction, which uses a lot of algorithm of Computer Vision.
In last year, I have already listened some courses of CV but I still have a lot to learn, so I choose this course.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? 
In most final projects of other courses, we only want to make something to get good grades from teacher.
But in CV, what I really want to do is to develope a tool or application based on computer vision to help people to solve something 
tricky in our daily life.
