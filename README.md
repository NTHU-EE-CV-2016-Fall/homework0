## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
I'm a student at NTHU with a major in Electrical Engineering. My hobbies are playing basketball, surfing net and programming. I've been as undergraduate research student in VSLab with project HandCam for a year. During this year, I have a basic knowledge of computer vision, machine learning and deep learning.
I have a strong interest in deep learning because of HandCam project. I think it's pretty cool to make a machine "think" and "learn" like a human, so I started to do research in this area.
I'm also a basketball lover. I've joined EE basketball team from freshman to senior, because of basketball, I got a strong body and clear brain so I can focus on everything.
