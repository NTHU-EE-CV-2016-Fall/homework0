This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
Hello, I am Johnson, Tsun-Hsuang Wang, 102061210. I am now studying 4th grade in EE department. I am interested computer vision
, machine learning, and deep learning. I have done a project about computer vision and image processing in my 3rd year, using 
traditional machine learning approaches like SVM and graph-based algorithm. Now I am learning neural network. I have tried some 
simple tasks like handwritten digit recognition or fine-tuning with prerained model found on the Internet using caffe and 
tensorflow. Besides, I am now looking blog posts and papers about RNN. I am now digging into neural turing machine.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
As mentioned in my self-introduction, I am interested in computer vision. Also, I have learned some computer vision by myself before.
However, I didn't systematically learn this subject. Hence, I hope I can have a more concrete concept over computer vision through 
this class.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I want to have a deeper understanding on computer vision, and I hope I can learn how to cope with data from a machine vision 
perspective. Finally, if I can do a spectacular final project, it will be awesome.
