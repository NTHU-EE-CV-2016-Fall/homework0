This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
Hi guys I am Ching-Yao Chuang aka James Chuang. I am currently a senior in department of Electrical Engineering. My research mainly focuses on Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In particular, I am interested in Convolutional/Recurrent Neural Networks architectures and recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. Here's my [personal website](http://jameschuanggg.github.io).

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
It's something closer to real AI rather then image processing. We let the machine learn and understand what it saw not just process them.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
Since most of the papers I read is about deep learning. I want to be more familiar with the traditional computer vision tech.

## Due Date: Sept. 24, 2016
